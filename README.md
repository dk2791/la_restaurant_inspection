# la_restaurant_inspection

Datasets with geographical data such as latitudes, longitudes, and FIPS codes lend themselves really well to visualization through mapping packages like Folium. While state codes and FIPS county codes are widely used in mapping packages, I wanted to map out ZIP code level data while working with GeoJSON.

We look at the LA county restaurant and market inspection dataset for this purpose. There are two separate csv files available: one for inspection records and one for violation records.
